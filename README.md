# woocommerce-testing
Selection of tests to prove the performance of a WooCoomerce installation. 

This project is in its embronic stages. 

## The Plan

Create a clear set of tests for WooCommerce that provide real world results. These tests can be automated either as a plugin on the server, or as a remote request set. 


## Who is part of this
There are two main groups. 

### independent review board
Known and unknown people from the WordPress/WooCommerce industry. These people are not running or working for hosting companies.

Their task is to keep the tests as unbiased as possible through a review process. 

### working team
Known and unknown people from the WordPress/WooCommerce/Hosting industry. Technical people that really understand the problems with making a performant hosting/WooCommerce situation.
